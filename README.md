I have had the idea to write something like this for a long time, but never got around to it. Today I ended up reinstalling my Ubuntu image so I could have more space on my harddrive, but I needed all my tools back. I figured I would put together this script now.

All the code is in the [ignition_key.sh](ignition_key.sh) script.
